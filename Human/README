This Model is released under the Terms of the GPL V2.

To add the Walker to your Aircraft
simly replace the <PropertyList> Entry at the top of your -set file with this:
			
			<PropertyList include="Aircraft/Human/Include/walker-include.xml">

This includes all Properties for the Walker, Key Bindings and a Menubar Entry. 
The Keys "a", "A" and "s" have their normal Binding when not in Walk View or 
Walker Orbit View.

To have a custom Exit Point add the following Properties to the <model> section 
in your Aircrafts -set file:

			<map>
				<default_exit>
					<x-offset-m type ="float">1</x-offset-m>
					<y-offset-m type ="float">3</y-offset-m>
				</default_exit>
			</map>

This specifies where the Walker Model appears.
